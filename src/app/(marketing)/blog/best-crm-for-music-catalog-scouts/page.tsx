          Most CRMs were built to manage a sales rep's quota. Music catalog
          scouting is a different sport: the deals are infrequent, the
          conversations are intimate, and the asset you're sourcing is human
          before it's a contract. The software has to know that — or it gets
          in the way.
        </Lede>

        <p>
          If you've spent any time looking for the right tool to run a music
          catalog scouting operation, you've probably noticed something
          uncomfortable. Every "best CRM" listicle returns the same five
          names: Pipedrive, HubSpot, Salesforce, Monday, Close. Plug your
          contacts in, drag deals across a pipeline, watch the dashboard fill
          up. Done.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then you try to actually use it for catalog scouting, and the
          friction starts showing up everywhere. The "deal" doesn't exist
          until ten back-and-forth DMs in. The "contact" lives on Instagram
          and you can't read your own messages without opening the app. The
          "stage" the prospect is in depends entirely on what got said in a
          conversation you can't search. The dashboard tells you you've got
          forty-three deals in stage 2. None of them know who you are yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          So scouts cobble together a stack. A spreadsheet. A Notion board.
          Instagram inbox open in another tab. A separate email tool. A
          calendar app for the calls. Maybe Hunter for lookups. Maybe a
          virtual assistant who lives in three of those tabs and ghosts the
          rest. The work gets done, eventually. But every operator who's done
          this for more than a few months arrives at the same realization:
          generic CRMs are not built for this sport.
        </p>

        <p>
          This piece is an honest look at what is actually needed in a tool
          for music catalog scouts and brokers, what the existing options get
          wrong, and what an actually-built-for-this-work platform looks
          like. We're going to use real category names — Pipedrive, HubSpot,
          Salesforce, ManyChat, Instantly — and we're going to be specific
          about where each one fits and where it breaks. And yes, we built
          Praecora because we believe a better answer existed, so this isn't
          a neutral review. But the parts about why generic CRMs don't fit
          are true regardless of which platform you eventually pick.
        </p>

        <h2>What makes the best CRM for a music industry sales operation?</h2>

        <p>
          Short answer: not the pipeline view. The thing that separates a
          working music industry CRM from a generic sales CRM is what
          surface the operator opens in the morning. For a SaaS rep, that
          surface is the deal pipeline. For a{' '}
          <a href="/blog/music-catalog-financing-broker-playbook">
            music broker
          </a>{' '}
          sourcing catalog financing deals, that surface needs to be the
          inbox — because most of the day's work happens before any deal
          object exists. The rest of this piece is a careful walkthrough
          of why that distinction matters, why the standard tools get it
          wrong, and what a CRM built for this specific work looks like
          in practice.
        </p>

        <h2>The job a catalog scout's CRM actually has to do</h2>

        <p>
          Before evaluating tools, it helps to be specific about the work.
          The reason generic CRMs fail this audience isn't because they're
          poorly built — most of them are excellent at what they're for. The
          reason is that the work itself is structurally different.
        </p>

        <p>
          A typical B2B SaaS sales rep starts the day with a list. Outbound
          targets. Calls to make. Sequences to monitor. Their CRM exists to
          manage <em>known prospects through a known pipeline</em>. The deal
          object is real on day one; what changes over time is which column
          it's sitting in.
        </p>

        <p>
          A music catalog scout starts the day with an inbox. A few hundred
          conversations in motion across two channels (Instagram and email),
          most of them between "first contact" and "first real reply." The
          deal object does not exist yet. What exists is a relationship in
          formation. The skill is in routing attention: which of the
          forty-three artists who replied this week is worth a real
          conversation, and which is going to ghost the moment money gets
          mentioned.
        </p>

        <p>
          That difference — relationship-first, deal-second — changes every
          surface of the tool. Specifically:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The inbox is the primary workspace.</strong> Not the
            pipeline. Most of the day's value comes from reading replies and
            sending good responses, not from dragging cards. A CRM that
            treats the inbox as a side tab is a CRM that doesn't understand
            the work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Channels matter.</strong> The artist is on Instagram.
            Their manager is on email. The same person — the artist's
            decision-making graph — is being worked across two surfaces in
            parallel. Tools that handle email well and Instagram badly (most
            of them) force you to context-switch every time you want to know
            where a relationship stands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Volume changes the math.</strong> Reading every reply by
            hand stops being feasible somewhere around fifty replies a day.
            The tool either classifies them for you — interested, not
            interested, manager handoff, ghost, follow-up — or you start
            missing real conversations because you're skimming.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Account safety isn't a feature, it's a substrate.</strong>{' '}
            Instagram accounts banned mid-conversation aren't a glitch to
            handle — they're the difference between a working business and a
            collapsed one. Tools that don't think about this at the
            infrastructure layer leave the operator holding the bag.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personalization at the opener.</strong> Cold openers that
            don't reference the artist's actual music get auto-classified
            as spam by the artist before they get classified as spam by
            Instagram. Templated openers don't work in this niche. The tool
            has to read the artist before it writes to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Commission, not quota.</strong> The economic unit is a
            closed deal at 10% commission, not pipeline coverage or activity
            metrics. Whatever dashboard exists has to track what was earned,
            what's pending, and which conversations have the highest expected
            value — not how many calls you made this week.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Now: what happens when you try to do this work in the standard B2B
          CRMs?
        </p>

        <h2>Where generic CRMs break for catalog scouts</h2>

        <h3>Pipedrive</h3>

        <p>
          Pipedrive is the friendliest of the generic CRMs and the one we
          recommend most often to operators who want a place to track deals
          that are already in motion. It's clean. It's affordable. The
          pipeline view is genuinely good. If you're running catalog
          scouting at a scale where most of your work is closing-stage
          conversation management — meaning you have a steady inflow from
          some other source and you just need to track who's where — it
          works.
        </p>

        <p>
          Where it breaks is at the front of the funnel. Pipedrive expects
          deals to exist. There is no native Instagram inbox; there's
          nothing to triage hundreds of replies a day. The contact record
          tells you nothing about whether the artist has 800 monthly
          listeners or 800,000. Personalization is on you. Volume is on you.
          And if you need to bring in a VA to handle the message-sending
          work, Pipedrive has no useful surface for that handoff either.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pipedrive is a deal tracker. Most of catalog scouting happens
          before the deal exists. That's the structural mismatch.
        </p>

        <h3>HubSpot</h3>

        <p>
          HubSpot is what people pick when they want a "real CRM." It's
          enormous, the free tier is generous, and it can do almost anything
          if you spend enough time configuring it. The trouble is the
          configuration cost is the cost. By the time you've taught HubSpot
          how a music catalog deal works — custom properties for streaming
          tier, monthly listeners, catalog size, advance multiple, sub-publisher
          status, manager relationship, sync history — you've spent more time
          building than scouting. And it still won't talk to Instagram in any
          useful way.
        </p>

        <p>
          HubSpot's marketing automation is also wrong-shaped for this work.
          It assumes you want to send the same email to a list of leads.
          Catalog scouting doesn't have "leads" in that sense; it has
          conversations, each with its own context, each of which is going
          to take a different turn next. Sequence-based automation pushes
          you toward writing more generic messages, which is the opposite of
          what works with artists.
        </p>

        <h3>Salesforce</h3>

        <p>
          Salesforce is for organizations large enough to have a Salesforce
          admin. Independent music catalog scouts are not those organizations.
          If you're working solo or with one VA and a Salesforce instance,
          something has gone wrong upstream. Skip.
        </p>

        <h3>Close, Outreach, Salesloft, Apollo</h3>

        <p>
          The B2B sales-engagement category. Built for SDRs running outbound
          sequences over LinkedIn and email. Two problems for catalog
          scouts: (1) they're built around <em>sequence cadences</em>, not
          per-artist personalization, which is the exact wrong direction;
          and (2) the Instagram support is universally weak — usually a
          basic API integration that doesn't survive the way Instagram
          actually enforces things. These tools are excellent for SaaS
          outbound. They're the wrong substrate for music outreach.
        </p>

        <h3>ManyChat, MobileMonkey, LinkDM, InstantDM</h3>

        <p>
          The Instagram automation category. These are the tools that show
          up when you Google "Instagram DM tool." They are not CRMs and they
          are not designed for cold outbound — they're designed for
          conversational marketing triggered by{' '}
          <em>opt-in signals</em> (a comment with a keyword, a story reply, a
          tap on an ad). If a user comments "GUIDE" on your post, ManyChat
          DMs them a link. That's the model.
        </p>

        <p>
          Catalog scouting does the opposite. You're sending the first
          message to someone who hasn't engaged with you yet. The entire
          permission model these tools are built around doesn't exist in your
          work. We wrote a full breakdown of this in{' '}
          <a href="/blog/praecora-vs-manychat">Praecora vs ManyChat</a> — the
          short version is: ManyChat is a great tool for the wrong job.
        </p>

        <Callout label="The honest read">
          <p>
            None of these tools are bad. Each one was built for a job that
            isn't yours. If you're a SaaS founder doing LinkedIn outbound,
            use Outreach. If you run a Shopify brand doing conversational
            sales, use ManyChat. If you have a 50-person sales team selling
            into the enterprise, configure Salesforce. The argument here
            isn't that those tools are broken — it's that the shape of
            music catalog scouting work doesn't fit any of them, and trying
            to make it fit costs you more than you think.
          </p>
        </Callout>

        <h2>What a CRM built for music catalog scouts looks like</h2>

        <p>
          Once you accept that this work has a different shape, what you need
          gets specific. Working backward from the daily reality of running a
          scouting operation, the must-haves look something like this:
        </p>

        <h3>One unified inbox across Instagram DMs and cold email</h3>

        <p>
          The artist is on Instagram. Their manager is on email. The lawyer
          who eventually drafts the deal memo is on email. Asking the
          operator to keep two inboxes mentally synced is asking them to do
          unpaid work that the software should handle. The right tool merges
          the two surfaces and keeps every conversation about a given artist
          threaded together, regardless of which channel each message came in
          on.
        </p>

        <h3>AI reply classification — but the operator stays in the loop</h3>

        <p>
          At Praecora-tier volume (hundreds of replies a day for serious
          operators), unclassified inboxes become a triage problem.
          "Interested." "Not now, ask me in six months." "I don't own my
          masters." "Send me the deck." "Who are you?" "Stop messaging me."
          These are different categories and they deserve different
          responses. A good tool reads them, tags them, and orders the inbox
          so you spend your minutes on the ones that move money. It does not
          auto-reply on your behalf. The voice that closes a deal is yours.
        </p>

        <h3>AI-drafted openers that actually read the artist</h3>

        <p>
          The line between effective and creepy is whether the message
          demonstrates real attention. "Hey love your sound" is a tell. "I've
          been on 'Hollow Bones' for two weeks — the bridge is doing
          something I haven't heard since Sufjan's <em>Carrie & Lowell</em>"
          is a different kind of message. The first one gets you ignored;
          the second one gets you a reply.
        </p>

        <p>
          The trick is that the second one takes ten minutes of listening
          per artist, and ten minutes × 140 artists × five days a week = a
          job. So the right tool reads the artist's bio, their last five
          posts, their Spotify catalog, and their public press footprint, and
          drafts something specific based on what it found. Praecora does
          this; we'll be honest that most of the value of the platform sits
          on this single capability.
        </p>

        <h3>A deal pipeline that works in catalog terms</h3>

        <p>
          Once a conversation crosses into deal territory — meaning the
          artist has asked something like "okay, what's the offer?" — you do
          need a pipeline. The pipeline has to speak catalog-finance, not
          SaaS. Realistic stages are: <em>qualified for offer</em>,{' '}
          <em>offer sent</em>, <em>negotiation</em>, <em>signed term sheet</em>,
          <em> diligence (royalty statements requested)</em>,{' '}
          <em>diligence cleared</em>, <em>closed</em>. Not "lead → MQL → SQL →
          opportunity."
        </p>

        <h3>Artist enrichment built in</h3>

        <p>
          You should not be tabbing over to Chartmetric, Spotify for Artists,
          Soundcharts, Apple Music for Artists, and Hunter every time a reply
          comes in. The basic data — monthly listeners, listener trajectory,
          catalog size, top track, label affiliation, manager contact — should
          live on the artist record automatically. The decision of "is this
          worth a real conversation?" should be a single glance.
        </p>

        <h3>Multi-account Instagram, safely</h3>

        <p>
          Serious scouts run more than one Instagram account. There's a
          ceiling on what one account can send before Instagram's
          anti-spam systems take notice. The right tool either handles
          multi-account orchestration itself or composes well with the
          infrastructure layer that does (cloud phones, alias accounts, IP
          isolation per account). We wrote more about this in{' '}
          <a href="/blog/run-multiple-instagram-accounts-without-bans">
            How to Run 7 Instagram Accounts Without Getting Banned
          </a>{' '}
          if you want the long version.
        </p>

        <h3>Commission tracking, not quota tracking</h3>

        <p>
          Independent scouts make money on closed deals at typical 10%
          commissions. The dashboard the operator opens in the morning should
          tell them: which conversations have the highest expected commission
          value, what's pending payment from prior closes, and what they've
          earned this month. Not "lead-to-meeting conversion rate." This is
          a commission business, not an activity business.
        </p>

        <PullQuote>
          The right tool reads the artist before it writes to them. The wrong
          tool makes you read the artist after the message has already gone
          out.
        </PullQuote>

        <h2>Where Praecora fits — and where it doesn't</h2>

        <p>
          We built Praecora because we'd run a music catalog scouting
          operation in-house and watched the existing tools fail it. The
          short version of the product: AI-drafted personalized Instagram
          DMs and cold emails sent on your behalf, a unified inbox where
          every reply lands AI-classified and ready for your one-click
          response, a deal pipeline that speaks catalog-finance, and a
          managed account infrastructure that does the unsexy work of
          keeping IG accounts alive past the 90-day cliff most people hit.
        </p>

        <p>
          What Praecora is good for:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Independent catalog scouts and brokers running solo or with a
            small VA team
          </li>
          <li>
            Operators who want to send 100–600+ personalized touches a day
            without typing any of them themselves
          </li>
          <li>
            Scouts who have closing skill but are bleeding hours into the
            mechanical work of outreach
          </li>
          <li>
            Anyone who has already lost an Instagram account fleet and wants
            to not lose the next one
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          What Praecora is <em>not</em> good for:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            People starting from zero with no industry context. Praecora
            scales operators; it doesn't replace knowing what a good deal
            looks like.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mass spammers. The infrastructure is built around per-artist
            personalization. We optimize against your trying to send the
            same message to 10,000 contacts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sales work outside this niche. We picked one audience on purpose.
            If you're selling B2B SaaS, use something else.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We charge between $700 and $2,800/month depending on volume, with
          an onboarding fee that covers the real labor of provisioning
          accounts and setting up the infrastructure. See{' '}

        <h2>What about building it yourself?</h2>

        <p>
          Some operators ask this. The answer is that the parts you can build
          quickly (a Notion board, a Google Sheet, a Zapier-stitched contact
          list) aren't the parts that take real time. The parts that take
          real time are: keeping Instagram accounts alive for 12+ months,
          training a model to draft openers that read the artist, building a
          reply-classification system that has enough catalog-finance
          vocabulary to be useful, and provisioning the email-sending
          infrastructure that survives platform-level reputation systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          We've been building this for two years. The infrastructure work
          alone is a small team's full attention. If you're a scout, your
          time compounds when you spend it on relationships and closes, not
          on devops. That's the case for buying the tool — or at least for
          not building it from scratch.
        </p>

        <h2>What to evaluate when picking your tool</h2>

        <p>
          Whether you choose Praecora, cobble something together, or use one
          of the generic options anyway, here's the checklist worth running
          against any candidate. If you can't answer "yes" to most of these,
          the tool is going to cost you hours every week.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Can I read and respond to Instagram DMs and email replies in one
            unified inbox without context-switching?
          </li>
          <li>
            When a reply comes in, does the tool already know whether it's
            interested, not interested, manager handoff, or noise?
          </li>
          <li>
            Are my outgoing messages drafted with reference to the artist's
            actual music — bio, posts, Spotify catalog — or am I writing
            them by hand?
          </li>
          <li>
            Does the artist record include the data I actually use to qualify
            (monthly listeners, catalog size, label status)?
          </li>
          <li>
            Does the pipeline have stages that match how catalog deals close,
            or am I forcing it to look like a SaaS funnel?
          </li>
          <li>
            What happens to my operation when an Instagram account gets
            banned? Is the loss isolated, or does it cascade?
          </li>
          <li>
            Can a VA run the mechanical parts of the work without ever
            touching my real Instagram credentials?
          </li>
          <li>
            Does the dashboard show commission earned, not just activity
            volume?
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The bottom line</h2>

        <p>
          "Best CRM for music catalog scouts" is a search that returns the
          wrong answer almost every time, because the question itself
          imports an assumption that doesn't hold — that catalog scouting is
          a pipeline-management problem. It isn't. It's a conversation-
          routing problem first, an account-infrastructure problem second,
          and a pipeline-management problem third.
        </p>

        <p>
          Get the first two right and the third becomes simple. Get the
          first two wrong and no amount of Pipedrive will save you.
        </p>
